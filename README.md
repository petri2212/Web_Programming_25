## Constraints
- You must create it on your own platform and populate it in a massive way (go ahead and use external sources, or create synthetic data with whatever system you think is useful
- the important thing is to have some numerosity and variety in the data)
- You will have to develop an application for which you will be given an interface template (one per group)
- Each application will have to make pages to look up data for each of the tables in the database - Where the data is linkable, create the said links.
